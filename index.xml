      <title>The SDLC Strikes Back: Adapting to AI-Driven Development</title>
      <link>http://annievella.com/posts/the-sdlc-strikes-back/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lovable.dev&#34;&gt;Lovable&lt;/a&gt; celebrated their biggest milestone yet - more than 12,000 (!) new projects created in a single day. The very next day, they went down. The irony? Their success became their downfall. Each new project in Lovable requires a new GitHub repository, and this surge - thousands per day - put such strain on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure that it risked affecting GitHub&amp;rsquo;s entire platform. Their on-call engineer had to make the difficult decision to suspend Lovable&amp;rsquo;s account, effectively blocking all users from creating or editing their projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now spent a couple of months using &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeium.com/windsurf&#34;&gt;Windsurf&lt;/a&gt; fairly regularly and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of my experiences with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To set the scene, I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer with over 20 years experience. I have a degree in Computer Science and Math and spent the first half of my career in hands-on individual contributor roles across 7 industries and 4 countries. I would generally describe myself as a C# .NET backend dev but I&amp;rsquo;ve built my fair share of frontends and even some mobile apps. I&amp;rsquo;ve hopped back and forth between management and engineering roles over the last decade. I haven&amp;rsquo;t written code as part of my day job for about 5 years now. I still enjoy building software myself and have plenty of grand ideas that I&amp;rsquo;d love to bring to life, but sadly it just takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agents All The Way Down</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;strong&gt;agentic AI&lt;/strong&gt; absolutely fascinates me. An LLM on its own is already mind-blowing, but building much larger systems where hundreds of specialised LLMs work together as components, with yet another LLM orchestrating how it all works, is a whole other world. The possibilities for automation are endless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, software systems are just components stitched together to perform seemingly complex tasks, but the logic behind it all is very &lt;em&gt;deterministic&lt;/em&gt;. As software engineers, we write lines of code to tell computers to do very specific things, in very specific orders. The computer then executes those instructions in a deterministic way, and we&amp;rsquo;re left with a very predictable system that can be hard to change or adapt to new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 In Review: Expanding Horizons</title>
      <link>http://annievella.com/posts/2024-in-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2024 was a massive year for me, and even that feels like an understatement. I pushed myself to my limits in many ways, but have enjoyed every second of it. After all, if you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable, you&amp;rsquo;re not growing, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My passion for continuous learning kicked into overdrive these past couple of years, leading me down fascinating intellectual paths. Could it be that AI has helped make information more accessible? Or is it that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found my calling? I can&amp;rsquo;t really say for sure, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself deeply immersed in several interconnected domains:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dear Software Engineer: It&#39;s Time to Reclaim Your Role</title>
      <link>http://annievella.com/posts/dear-software-engineer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apologies, this is a long one - clearly I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to say on this subject!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long after ChatGPT was released for me to start seeing how fundamentally this technology could transform software engineering. Not just as another tool in our arsenal, but as something that could redefine what it means to be a software engineer entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discourse around this has been fascinating. Jump on LinkedIn or X and you&amp;rsquo;ll see endless debates about whether AI will augment or replace software engineers, whether it&amp;rsquo;s just another productivity tool or a paradigm shift, whether it&amp;rsquo;s overhyped or understated. But I think many are missing the real story - it&amp;rsquo;s not about whether AI will take our jobs, it&amp;rsquo;s about how it&amp;rsquo;s already changing the very nature of our profession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in an era where rapid solutions are celebrated. The quicker we solve a problem, the more productive we appear. But what if, in our rush to get to a resolution, we&amp;rsquo;re missing the mark entirely? Albert Einstein&amp;rsquo;s timeless quote, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, resonates deeply in todayâ€™s fast-paced, technology-driven world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to step onto a stage. In 2023, I decided to face my fear of public speaking head-on, embracing the mantra &amp;ldquo;practice makes better.&amp;rdquo; Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve jumped at every opportunity to talk about topics I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about, and it&amp;rsquo;s been an incredibly rewarding journey. Engaging with diverse minds at conferences and meetups has been especially fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Agentic AI the Key to Automating Human Work?</title>
      <link>http://annievella.com/posts/is-agentic-ai-the-key-to-automating-human-work/</link>

      <guid>http://annievella.com/posts/is-agentic-ai-the-key-to-automating-human-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been contemplating the concept of &lt;em&gt;agentic AI&lt;/em&gt; for a while now. The idea that we can create specialised AI agents, each mastering a specific task, and have them work together iteratively struck me as a powerful way to really harness the power of AI to tackle complex problems. After all, that&amp;rsquo;s how teams of humans working together accomplish amazing outcomes, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first encountered &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.agpt.co&#34;&gt;Auto-GPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; over a year ago and was intrigued enough to join their Discord community. At that time, the concept of autonomous AI agents was still in its early stages, and Auto-GPT was pioneering an approach that allowed AI systems to autonomously generate and execute their own goals. This innovative idea resonated with me, reinforcing my belief in the transformative potential of specialised AI agents across various industries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, I had the privilege of travelling from Auckland, New Zealand, to speak at &lt;strong&gt;StaffPlus London&lt;/strong&gt; - an unforgettable experience. Speaking at such a high-profile event, surrounded by so many talented Staff+ Engineers, was truly special. What made this event particularly memorable wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the prominence of the event but the opportunity to share something that has become deeply important to me: how the timeless teachings of &lt;strong&gt;W. Edwards Deming&lt;/strong&gt; remain as relevant today as ever in the constantly evolving world of technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring Systems Thinking Through Russell Ackoff</title>
      <link>http://annievella.com/posts/exploring-systems-thinking-through-russell-ackoff/</link>

      <guid>http://annievella.com/posts/exploring-systems-thinking-through-russell-ackoff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning about Deming has led me to another incredible thinker - Russell Ackoff. Born in 1919, Ackoff is best known for his contributions to Systems Thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one of his lectures, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/yGN5DBpW93g&#34;&gt;From Mechanistic to Systemic Thinking&lt;/a&gt;, Ackoff discusses systems and the difference between analysis and synthesis. He explains that the essential properties of a system are unique to the system as a whole. These properties arise from the interactions between the parts of the system. In other words, a system is more than the sum of its parts; it is the product of their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are You a Transactional or Developmental Leader?</title>
      <link>http://annievella.com/posts/are-you-a-transactional-or-developmental-leader/</link>

      <guid>http://annievella.com/posts/are-you-a-transactional-or-developmental-leader/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced world of tech, leadership styles can make or break an organisation&amp;rsquo;s success. Are you driving growth with a developmental mindset or merely maintaining the status quo with a transactional approach?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the best books Iâ€™ve read recently is Gene Kim and Steven Spearâ€™s &lt;a href=&#34;https://itrevolution.com/product/wiring-the-winning-organization/&#34;&gt;Wiring the Winning Organisation&lt;/a&gt;. It distils many great leadership theories into clear, actionable concepts. At the very end of the book, in Appendices A and B, they talk about the differences between transactional and developmental leadership. This is something I think about a lot but didnâ€™t know the precise terms for until reading these sections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s been about a month since I received my much-anticipated Apple Vision Pro. Truth be told, I ordered it as soon as it became available in the US in early February 2024. With the help of some truly wonderful friends, I figured it wouldnâ€™t be too hard to get my hands on one. Unfortunately, that wasnâ€™t the case, but after jumping through various hoops, I finally got my hands on it in late March. Iâ€™m endlessly thankful to my friends for everything they had to go through - I hope to be able to repay the favour one day!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is a Good Strategy?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strategies play a critical role in aligning teams towards a common goal, especially in large organisations. Being able to create, review and execute a good strategy is an important aspect of many leadership roles, yet itâ€™s a hard one to nail. Even defining what makes a strategy truly effective can be surprisingly challenging - ask ten different leaders and you&amp;rsquo;re likely to get ten different interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More often than not, what people describe as a strategy is actually an aspirational goal or vision. They articulate &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; we want to go but not &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Early Exploration of AI-First Development</title>

      <guid>http://annievella.com/posts/an-early-exploration-of-ai-first-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, the core of software engineering has remained fairly stable despite the fast pace of technological advancement. Weâ€™ve had other &amp;ldquo;-First&amp;rdquo; methodologies like Code-First and API-First, which reshaped aspects of the SDLC, but not fundamentally so. However, with the advent of generative AI, weâ€™re left wondering: what will AI-First development look like, and how will it change our familiar landscape? As a software engineer who has loved being one for many years, I&amp;rsquo;m truly intrigued by AI-First development - how it might transform software building processes, redefine software engineers&amp;rsquo; roles, and what we can do now to best prepare for this new world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflection is something I really enjoy and do rather frequently. There&amp;rsquo;s something about revisiting old memories with fresh eyes that I find fascinating and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One memory that frequently pops into my mind from my high school days is the time I received a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte&#34;&gt;Magritte&lt;/a&gt; art book as a prize for my achievements in mathematics. This really threw me. Had there been a mix-up? An art book for a science nerd like me seemed so out of place. But, as it turned out, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly where its magic lay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Returning to work after the holiday season, I find myself reflecting on a rather remarkable 2023. It was a year where innovative technologies like generative AI and advancements in quantum computing moved beyond mere buzzwords, inspiring me to delve deeper into my curiosity and passions. This reawakening not only captured my attention but also reinforced my belief in the transformative power of technology. Discovering Deming and his philosophy was a turning point for me, providing clarity and reinforcing my principles in quality, continuous improvement and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I felt that my first proper blog post after a 10+ year blogging hiatus should be one about something that Iâ€™m really passionate about and close to my heart, so letâ€™s dive into a topic thatâ€™s been on my mind for years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of us who embark upon a career in tech do so because we love working with computers. We become engineers because weâ€™re curious beings, who thrive on the challenge of solving tricky problems. We like designing, building, debugging, and fixing systems, and thankfully, thereâ€™s no shortage of this type of work (at least not yet - Iâ€™m convinced the recent advancements in AI may change this, but thatâ€™s a topic for another day).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long break from blogging, I&amp;rsquo;m back.
