      <p>Writing has never come naturally to me - I was always a science and maths kid through and through. But many moons ago, my dad convinced me to take English in my final year of high school with words that have stuck with me ever since: <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point having all that knowledge if you can&rsquo;t communicate it&rdquo;</em>. Through blogging and speaking, I&rsquo;ve been working on that, and slowly but surely, I&rsquo;m being asked to contribute to publications beyond my own site.</p>
<p>Below is a list of publications I&rsquo;ve contributed to.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like me to write for or collaborate on your publication, please feel free to <a href="mailto:annie.luxton@gmail.com">get in touch</a>. I&rsquo;d love to connect!</p>
