          <p>In the years I&rsquo;ve been building software, I&rsquo;ve lived through more than a few waves. My first taste of code was in the mid‑80s, typing BASIC into a Commodore 64 where you couldn&rsquo;t even save your work to a hard drive. In the mid‑90s, scripting in mIRC and hand‑rolling simple HTML sites felt cutting edge. The early 2000s were all about desktop apps, then web apps that suddenly got a lot more dynamic - yet for a while, Flash was still the only way to refresh part of a page without the user hammering the browser&rsquo;s refresh button. Then AJAX arrived and changed that.</p>

          <p>When I came across a recent Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/08/research-the-hidden-penalty-of-using-ai-at-work">article</a> on the hidden penalty of using AI at work, it wasn&rsquo;t the AI part that stood out to me, even though I&rsquo;m studying this very topic as part of my Master&rsquo;s of Engineering. Yes, the AI findings were interesting, but what stopped me in my tracks was something else: the &ldquo;competence penalty&rdquo; women pay.</p>
<p>The research put numbers to it:</p>
<blockquote class="large-quote" style="font-size: 1.5em; margin: 30px 40px 30px 40px">The competence penalty was more than twice as severe for female engineers, who faced a 13% reduction compared to 6% for male engineers.</blockquote>
<p>The experiment was simple: engineers reviewed the exact same piece of Python code, with the only difference being whether they were told it had been written with the assistance of AI. Turns out women are essentially carrying a heavier burden of doubt for the same contributions.</p>

          <p>A few weeks ago, I had a conversation that&rsquo;s stayed with me. A colleague from another department said: <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been able to read and understand code, even debug it, but I could never write it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Something about this revelation stayed with me. Most people I&rsquo;ve met outside the software engineering world tend to describe code as unintelligible - like hieroglyphics. I guess that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always assumed: if someone couldn&rsquo;t write code, they probably couldn&rsquo;t read it either.</p>

          <p>The recent releases of Claude Code and OpenAI Codex caught my attention, but not for the reasons you might expect. I was puzzled by the enthusiasm they&rsquo;ve generated. These are, after all, terminal tools. In an era where graphical IDEs dominate, with tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCode evolving toward ever-more seamless integrations, like &lsquo;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomkrcha_introducing-design-mode-for-cursor-activity-7325527044459524096-tqy7">Design Mode</a>&rsquo;, why are we getting excited about terminal-based AI coding tools that feel like a step backwards?</p>

          <p>We don’t talk enough about the <em>feeling</em> of learning something deeply - the slow, sometimes frustrating and painful process that forges real intuition.</p>
<p>As software engineers, we know this feeling intimately. The slow burn of mastering a new concept or language. The pressure and anxiety of resolving your first production issue. The endless hours spent debugging a complex system that just won&rsquo;t work - until, at last, it does. And how that struggle itself is the point: it&rsquo;s what transforms a beginner coder into a software engineer with real intuition.</p>

          <p>Many of us became software engineers because we found our identity in building things. Not managing things. Not overseeing things. <em>Building</em> things. With our own hands, our own minds, our own code.</p>
<p>But that identity is being challenged.</p>
<p>AI coding assistants aren&rsquo;t just changing how we write software - they&rsquo;re fundamentally transforming <em>who we are</em>. We&rsquo;re shifting from creators to orchestrators, from builders to overseers. From engineers to something that looks suspiciously like&hellip; managers.</p>

          <p>In an era where tech stacks grow ever more complex and teams become increasingly specialised, there&rsquo;s profound wisdom to be found in looking back at simpler, more effective approaches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about my experience at <a href="https://www.trademe.co.nz/">Trade Me</a> for years. Earlier this week, I attended the launch of <a href="https://rowansimpson.com">Rowan Simpson</a>&rsquo;s new book, <a href="https://howtobewrongbook.com">How to Be Wrong</a>. Rowan hired me into his team at Trade Me back in 2006, and to my delight, I even earned a mention in his book! That unexpected recognition, along with recently reading <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/industry-examples/trade-me-journey-towards-a-thinnest-viable-platform">this article</a> about Trade Me&rsquo;s journey toward a &ldquo;thinnest viable platform&rdquo;, finally motivated me to reflect on what remains one of my best professional experiences to this day.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://lovable.dev">Lovable</a> celebrated their biggest milestone yet - more than 12,000 (!) new projects created in a single day. The very next day, they went down. The irony? Their success became their downfall. Each new project in Lovable requires a new GitHub repository, and this surge - thousands per day - put such strain on GitHub&rsquo;s infrastructure that it risked affecting GitHub&rsquo;s entire platform. Their on-call engineer had to make the difficult decision to suspend Lovable&rsquo;s account, effectively blocking all users from creating or editing their projects.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve now spent a couple of months using <a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a> fairly regularly and I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my experiences with it.</p>
<p>To set the scene, I&rsquo;m a software engineer with over 20 years experience. I have a degree in Computer Science and Math and spent the first half of my career in hands-on individual contributor roles across 7 industries and 4 countries. I would generally describe myself as a C# .NET backend dev but I&rsquo;ve built my fair share of frontends and even some mobile apps. I&rsquo;ve hopped back and forth between management and engineering roles over the last decade. I haven&rsquo;t written code as part of my day job for about 5 years now. I still enjoy building software myself and have plenty of grand ideas that I&rsquo;d love to bring to life, but sadly it just takes too long.</p>
